# Ceasar-Cipher
A Caesar Cipher programmed in Python. The cipher encrypts text by shifting the letters in the text down the alphabet by a specified value (e.g. 'abc' shifted by a value of two would be 'cde'). The program can also decrypt Caesar Cipher encrypted texts without knowing the original shift value. It does so by attempting to decrypt the text using various shift values and picking the value which ends up producing a decrypted text that is made up of valid English words instead of gibberish. 

This program was made as part of an assignment for MIT's "6.0001 Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python" course.
